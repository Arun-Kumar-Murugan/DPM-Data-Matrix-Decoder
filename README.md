# DPM-Data-Matrix-Decoder
This repository provides a robust Python-based solution for decoding DPM (Direct Part Marking) Data Matrix codes from images. It leverages OpenCV and pylibdmtx for efficient image preprocessing and barcode recognition, enabling accurate decoding even under challenging lighting or low-contrast conditions commonly seen in industrial environments.
